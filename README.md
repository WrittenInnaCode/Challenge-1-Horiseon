# <Challenge-1-Horiseon>

## Description

The purpose of this project was to learn how to refactor an existing code in order to improve it without changing what it does. To achieve this, the CSS code was reworked to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties; they were organized to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements. Furthermore, the website was made more accessible with an addition of alt tags for images. By completing this challenge, I learned the Scout Rule and the importance of making a website accessible.
